1. Introduction	                                        *cwb-intro*

cwb.vim is very small plug-in for opening files and running commands in the
Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench through Vim, as editing inside the program is
so unpleasant that the bundled Emacs interactive mode is the official
recommended way to use the program.

==============================================================================
2. Setup                                                *cwb-setup*

Before installing the plug-in, should both the Edinburgh Concurrency
Workbench, and the program Expect be installed, as the plug-in depends upon
them.

Installing cwb.vim can be done either manually by copying the files and
folders into your .vim folder, or using a plug-in manager such as Pathogen
or Vundle.

After installation is it necessary to set the path to the workbench 
executable, by adding the below to your .vimrc.

    let g:CWBPath = "/path/to/cwb/"

Expect should be detected by Which, but must otherwise also be set manually.

2. Usage                                                *cwb-usage*

                                                        *:OpenInCWB*
:OpenInCWB                  Loads the file in the buffer into cwb and displays
                            the output in a right vsplit.

                                                        *:OpenAndRunCommandInCWB*
:OpenAndRunCommandInCWB     Loads the file in the buffer into cwb, and 
                            executes an arbitrary command provided by the
                            user.

==============================================================================
3. Options                                              *cwb-options*

g:CWBPath                   Path to cwb on your system, must be set for the 
                            plug-in to work.

g:ExpectPath                Path to Expect on your system, it is only 
                            necessary to set this if your system does not have
                            Which installed, or if expect is not included in
                            path.

g:CWBOutputBuffer           Name of buffer used for the output from cwb, 
                            the plug-in will clean and use the buffer if it
                            already exists
